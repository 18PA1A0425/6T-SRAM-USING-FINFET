# 6T-SRAM-USING-FINFET
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 6T SRAM USING FINFET FOR LOW POWER APPLICATION


  CMOS devices are facing many problems because the gate starts losing control over the channel. These problems include increase in leakage currents, increase of current, increase in manufacturing cost, large variations in parameters, less reliability and yield, short channel effects etc.
	The conventional CMOS used in the design of SRAM, is also facing the problem of high-power dissipation and increase in leakage current which affects its performance badly. Memories are required to have short access time, less power dissipation and low leakage current. Thus, FINFET based SRAM cells are recommended over CMOS based SRAM cells. Reducing the leakage aspects of the SRAM cells has been very essential to enhance the stability of the cell. Therefore, many low power techniques are used to reduce the power dissipation and leakage currents. These include Multi Threshold CMOS (MTCMOS), Variable Threshold CMOS (VTCMOS), Self-controllable voltage level (SVL) technique, etc.
	In this project, we propose the use of MTCMOS technique to design a FINFET SRAM cell and compare it with a FINFET SRAM cell in terms of dynamic power dissipation. All the simulations are done on Synopsys HSPICE tool using 14nm technology and Predictive Technology Model (PTM).
